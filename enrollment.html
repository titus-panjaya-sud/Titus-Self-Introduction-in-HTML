    <h2>Enrollment in Front-End Engineering Class</h2>

    <h3>Rationale</h3>
    <p id = "Rat">Professor F. Holliday encouraged me to take this class as he said it is essential for every computer scientist to know how to create a website for himself/herself.<br>
    Secondly, I was pretty excited, too, when I saw that Prof. Chary Vielma would teach this class.<br>
    I had a brief affinity with her in CPSC 301; I think she is a cool, patient, and helpful professor.</p>

    <h3>Personal Interests & Past Experience</h3>
    <p id = "PIPE">I used to blog a lot during elementary school when Facebook was still not available.<br>
    I maintained a visually appealing personal website and often competed with friends for the most creative website.<br>
    I even designed blog templates for my friends, class, and student clubs to use. <br>
    However, I stopped blogging towards the junior year of middle school as my sinister Asian parents think I was wasting time on that.<br>
  It's been almost a decade since I last touched HTML, so I thought I might revise it and break out of my shell to create my site from scratch without the use of hosting sites.</p>  </section>

    <h3>Reflections</h3>
    <p id = "Ref">I am very thankful for the opportunities I received in this class.<br>
    I managed to get into a group where the other four students are native Mandarin Speakers.<br>
    We did our discussion in Mandarin; I get to practice my Mandarin in a professional setting and experience a different working culture.<br>
    This experience helps me to prepare for my career development in Taiwan in the future.</p>
