    <h2>Enrollment in Front-End Engineering Class</h2>
    <h3>Rationale</h3>
    <p>Professor F. Holliday encouraged me to take this class as he said it is essential for every computer scientist to know how to create a website for himself/herself.</p>
    <p>Secondly, I was pretty excited, too, when I saw that Prof. Chary Vielma would teach this class.</p>
    <p>I had a brief affinity with her in CPSC 301; I think she is a cool, patient, and helpful professor.</p>

    <h3>Personal Interests & Past Experience</h3>
    <p>I used to blog a lot during elementary school when Facebook was still not available. </p>
    <p>I maintained a visually appealing personal website and often competed with friends for the most creative website.</p>
    <p>I even designed blog templates for my friends, class, and student clubs to use. </p>
    <p>However, I stopped blogging towards the junior year of middle school as my sinister Asian parents think I was wasting time on that.</p>
    <p>It's been almost a decade since I last touched HTML, so I thought I might revise it and break out of my shell to create my site from scratch without the use of hosting sites.</p>

    <h3>Reflections</h3>
    <p>I am very thankful for the opportunities I received in this class.</p>
    <p>I managed to get into a group where the other four students are native Mandarin Speakers.</p>
    <p>We did our discussion in Mandarin; I get to practice my Mandarin in a professional setting and experience a different working culture.</p>
    <p>This experience helps me to prepare for my career development in Taiwan in the future.</p>
