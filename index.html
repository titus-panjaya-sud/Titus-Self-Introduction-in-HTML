    <h2>Enrollment in Front-End Engineering Class</h2>
    <h3>Rationale</h3>
    <p>Professor F. Holliday encouraged me to take this class as he said it is essential for every computer scientist to know how to create a website for himself/herself.</p>
    <p>Secondly, I was pretty excited, too, when I saw that Prof. Chary Vielma would teach this class.</p>
    <p>I had a brief affinity with her in CPSC 301; I think she is a cool, patient, and helpful professor.</p>
    </br>
    <h3>Personal Interests & Past Experience</h3>
    <p>I used to blog a lot during elementary school when Facebook was still not available. </p>
    <p>I maintained a visually appealing personal website and often competed with friends for the most creative website.</p>
    <p>I even designed blog templates for my friends, class, and student clubs to use. </p>
    <p>However, I stopped blogging towards the junior year of middle school as my sinister Asian parents think I was wasting time on that.</p>
    <p>It's been almost a decade since I last touched HTML, so I thought I might revise it and break out of my shell to create my site from scratch without the use of hosting sites.</p>


    </br>
    <h3>Reflections</h3>
    <p>I am very thankful for the opportunities I received in this class.</p>
    <p>I managed to get into a group where the other four students are native Mandarin Speakers.</p>
    <p>We did our discussion in Mandarin; I get to practice my Mandarin in a professional setting and experience a different working culture.</p>
    <p>This experience helps me to prepare for my career development in Taiwan in the future.</p>

    <h2>Photo Album</h2>
    <h3>1. Early-Graduation Photo</h3>

    <span class="thumbnail-title">Early Grad Pic</span>
    </a>
    </li>




    <p>I took this photo after Spring Semester 2020 ended.</p>
    <p>I feel that I might die any day if I were to get caught with COVID-19;</p>
    <p>So I should at least take a grad picture to send it to my parents back in my Indonesian hometown.</p>


    <h3>2. Who's dis kiddo?</h3>

    <span class="thumbnail-title">Who's kid?</span>
    </a>
    </li>


    <p>In many Asian Traditions, the birthday kid will be treated with drumstick and a red egg.</p>
    <p>Cracking the red eggs and breaking the shell during birthday symbolize rebirth.</p>
    </br>
    <p>But if there are too many red eggs prepared, there is a creative way to celebrate it!</p>
    <p>Smash it on the birthday boy/girl's head! It is said to make them smarter. </p>
    <p>And this brings you to the third photo:</p>
    <h3>3. Friends come first or the eggs?</h3>
