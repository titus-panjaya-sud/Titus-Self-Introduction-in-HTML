    <h3>1. Early-Graduation Photo</h3>

    </a>

    <p>I took this photo after Spring Semester 2020 ended.</p>
    <p>I feel that I might die any day if I were to get caught with COVID-19;</p>
    <p>So I should at least take a grad picture to send it to my parents back in my Indonesian hometown.</p>

    <p>In many Asian Traditions, the birthday kid will be treated with drumstick and a red egg.</p>
    <p>Cracking the red eggs and breaking the shell during birthday symbolize rebirth.</p>

    <p>But if there are too many red eggs prepared, there is a creative way to celebrate it!</p>
    <p>Smash it on the birthday boy/girl's head! It is said to make them smarter. </p>
    <p>And this brings you to the third photo:</p>
